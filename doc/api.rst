DskLayout API
*************

This is an official API documentation for the dsklayout_ python package.

Introduction
============

The dsklayout_ package provides an application and a library composed of
several modules. The package was designed to be independent of extra packages
as much as possible, thus it repeats some work already done by others (such as
graph implementation and algorithms).
